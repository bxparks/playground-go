      # Fix an obscure permission problem among: git, tinygo, go, and docker.
      #
      # First, `tinygo` prints this error message, which points to a flag
      # from `go`:
      #   error obtaining VCS status: exit status 128
      #   Use -buildvcs=false to disable VCS stamping.
      #
      # Second, running `git status` in the container prints this message:
      #   fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at
      #   '/__w/playgroundgo/playgroundgo'
      #   To add an exception for this directory, call:
      #   git config --global --add safe.directory
      #       /__w/playgroundgo/playgroundgo
      #
      # We have to run this `git config` command to fix those problems.
